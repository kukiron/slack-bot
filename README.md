# Slack Onboarding Bot

This is an experiment - this project demonstrates how to build a Slack bot using Slack's Events API.

The example project is adapted from Slack's [example Onboarding app](https://github.com/slackapi/onboarding-example), but with support for OAuth.

## Getting Started
To get started you need to:

- Set up your Slack App in Slack
- Copy across the Slack API tokens into the .env file
